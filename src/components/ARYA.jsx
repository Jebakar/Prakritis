          <p>
            In the Eighties this ancient medical system was practiced in a very primitive way in which the “Vaidya” gave only a prescription and methodology to mix herbs. The patient had the responsibility to acquire the requisite herbs, grams etc., and prepare them as per prescription. This was very laborious and wanting accurateness and authenticity.
          </p>

          <p>
            It was during this period Late Vaidyaratnam P.S. Varier came into this arena and realizing these drawbacks introduced the scientific method of preparing and preserving medicines. He gave a tremendous impetus and push to Ayurvedic treatment and practice. This also gave in turn a great popularity boost to Ayurveda.

          <p>
            In his wisdom he produced “Vishuchikari” pills to combat Cholera epidemic which engulfed Kottakkal in 1902. By his own effort he contained the spread and saved a calamity. Step by step he developed this into an institution of world renown and today Arya Vaidya Sala, Kottakkal has under its umbrella an Ayurvedic medical college, hospital, a research and development wing, a charitable hospital which utilizes hefty percent of the trust’s income.

          <p>
            It has also developed huge farm-lands where rare medicinal plants and herbs are grown and modern manufacturing units to meet the increasing demand for ready-to-use Ayurvedic medicines.
          </p>

          <p>
            Arya Vaidya Sala, Kottakkal is run as a trust by the family of Vaidyaratnam P.S. Varier and his vision is propagated by the trust board. Today, it is chaired by Padmasri Dr. P.K. Varier, the nephew of Vaidyaratnam P.S. Varier and uncle of Late Captain N.S. Ramachandran (Managing Partner of PRAKRITI AYURVEDA).
          </p>

          <p>
            Late Captain N.S. Ramachandran, who retired as Managing Director – Operations of Indian Airlines, started Prakriti Ayurveda. His inhibition was to continue and spread this wonderful system with all sincerity and warmth which is now being carried forward by his wife Mrs. Meena Ramachandran and daughter-in-law Mrs. Sujatha Ramachandran.

          <p>
            Traditionally, the treatment of this system is avoided during summer months. We have overcome this restriction by providing air-conditioned environment to achieve the desired temperature levels.
          </p>

          <p>
            An important aspect of an Ayurvedic treatment is “Swedanam” or sweating the impurities out. For the comfort of urban man, we have replaced the traditional steam bath by a state-of-the-art Sauna.
          </p>

          <p>
            To enhance the effectiveness of our treatment, we have evolved a computerized system which will keep the profile of each individual, the type of treatment given, and get a feedback of the result. In effect this would mean, as per our Motto, “we care for you and we take care of everyone who approaches us.”
