          <p>
            Prakriti’s USP is the packaging of an ancient health science into an urban surrounding, maintaining high levels of cleanliness and evolving health and treatment packages that are more user-friendly, without deviating from the fundamentals of Ayurveda.
          </p>

          <p>
            Prakriti was conceptualized by Late Capt. N. S. Ramachandran whose family runs the world renowned Arya Vaidya Sala, at Kottakkal, Kerala – which may be referred to as a pioneer in various aspects of Ayurvedic Practices. Prakriti, in letters and spirit follows the good practices of this Great institution. All medicines prescribed and used are of Arya Vaidya Sala, Kottakkal.

          <p>
            All our therapies and curative treatments for various ailments are authentic, un-diluted and synchronized Ayurvedic practices which are strictly adhered to and there are no short cuts, all monitored by the Doctor. Ayurveda has no side effects and it goes to the root of the ailment.
